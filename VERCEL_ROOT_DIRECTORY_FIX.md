# 🚨 VERCEL ROOT DIRECTORY ISSUE - DEFINITIVE FIX

## ❌ **PROBLEM CONFIRMED**
Vercel is building from **ROOT directory** (`/`) instead of **`admin-dashboard/`**

**Evidence**: 
- Build log shows: "Running vercel build" from root
- Still getting "Function Runtimes" error
- This happens when Vercel doesn't have the correct Root Directory set

## ✅ **DEFINITIVE SOLUTION**

### **You MUST Configure Root Directory in Vercel Dashboard**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Click on your `memory-box-admin` project**
3. **Go to "Settings" tab**
4. **Click "General" in the left sidebar**
5. **Find "Root Directory" section**
6. **Set it to**: `admin-dashboard`
7. **Click "Save"**
8. **Redeploy the project**

### **Alternative: Delete and Recreate Project**

If the settings don't work:

1. **Delete current project** completely
2. **Import `eduardoinoa18/memory-box` again**  
3. **During import, set**:
   ```
   ✅ Framework: Next.js
   ✅ Root Directory: admin-dashboard    ← CRITICAL!
   ✅ Project Name: memory-box-admin
   ```

## 🎯 **Root Cause Analysis**

**What's happening**:
- ❌ Vercel builds from `/` (finds no proper package.json)
- ❌ Looks for configuration files in root
- ❌ Encounters empty builds array in old cached configs
- ❌ Fails with "Function Runtimes" error

**What should happen**:
- ✅ Vercel builds from `/admin-dashboard`
- ✅ Uses `admin-dashboard/package.json`
- ✅ Uses `admin-dashboard/vercel.json`
- ✅ Builds Next.js app successfully

## 📋 **Verification Steps**

After fixing Root Directory, build log should show:
```
✅ Cloning to admin-dashboard/
✅ Installing dependencies from admin-dashboard/package.json
✅ Building Next.js application
✅ Success!
```

**🎯 THE ISSUE**: Root Directory is NOT set to `admin-dashboard` in your Vercel project settings. Fix this first!
