## 🎯 CURRENT ISSUE & SOLUTION

**Problem**: Expo has dependency conflicts causing startup errors.

**Quick Solutions**:

### Option 1: Simple Web Demo (5 minutes)
```powershell
# Create a simple demo mode
$env:EXPO_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE = "true"
npm run start:demo
```

### Option 2: Fix Dependencies (10 minutes)
```powershell
# Clean install
Remove-Item node_modules -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item package-lock.json -Force

```

### Option 3: Use Simple Package.json (Fastest)
I can create a minimal package.json with only essential dependencies.

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED: START SIMPLE

Let's use **Option 3** - I'll create a minimal version that will definitely work:

1. **Strip down to essentials**: Only Firebase + React Native
2. **Remove problematic packages**: Clean dependency tree
3. **Launch immediately**: Get you testing in 2 minutes

**What would you like to try first?**

A) **Fix current setup** (Option 2 above)
B) **Create minimal version** (Option 3 - recommended)  
C) **Show me demo mode** (Option 1)
